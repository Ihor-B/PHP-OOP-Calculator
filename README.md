PHP-OOP-Calculator
==================

This is a simple calculator web application that will allow an end user to choose type of calculation and see a result. Application developed in a client‐server architecture using PHP and javascript. 

Key functionality:
* Application interface based on the design attached to this test
* Perform 6 arithmetic operations on two values specified by the customer
* Show result of the calculation
* Show summary of the calculation

Created a simple Javascript client that provide an interface to allow client‐side code to call the server application methods. The Javascript client is responsible for creating a HTTP GET request to the application server and handling resulting HTTP response. 

Client should also gracefully handle network and HTTP errors as well as basic input checks.
